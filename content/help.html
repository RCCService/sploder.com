<h4>Creating a New Game</h4>

<p>When you start the creator, it begins with a blank playfield for you to begin building a new game.  The procedure for creating 
a game is as follows:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Change the shape of your playfield by dragging and adding points to the edges of the playfield.</li>
	<li>Change the color of your playfield if you wish.</li>
	<li>Add objects to your game.</li>
	<li>Move and rotate the objects as you see fit.</li>
	<li>Save your game.</li>
	<li>Preview if necessary, and then publish.</li>
	<li>Email a link to your friends if you wish.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Previewing your game</h4>

your game, you can see how it will play, then tweak it again after you are done.</p>

<h4>Publishing your game</h4>

<p>To publish your game, select <span class="menuref">Publish</span>.  You will see a dialogue box where you can choose whether or not you want it to be private, and 
if you wish to allow people to comment on it.  Your game must be saved before you can publish it.  Saving your game will only save the project data to the server, it will not publish it. </p>

<p>Once you publish, you'll see a pop-up window with your published game.  You'll also see controls for entering a text 
description, obtaining HTML code to include it on your site, view and administrate comments, and e-mail it to friends.</p>

<h4>Emailing your game</h4>

<p>Emailing your game is simple.  On your published game screen, simply click the e-mail button and enter the person's email address to 
whom you want to send your game.  You can reach your publish page by publishing the game from the creator, or 
later by clicking on a game in &quot;My games&quot; on the main site.</p>
