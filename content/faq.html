<h4>How do I level up?</h4>

<p>You level up by participating in Sploder.  Play games and vote on them, create your own games, and make friends.  As you do this, your level will increase.  Leveling up will unlock certain items in the creators, and allow you to do more on Sploder.</p>

<h4>How do I make a group?</h4>

<p>You must be at least level 20 to make a group.  If you are, go to your dashboard, click "Groups" and then scroll down to the bottom of the page.  You'll see a widget that allows you to make a group.</p>

<h4>How do I make a game?</h4>

<p>Making games on Sploder works pretty much the same way whether you are creating a shooter, platformer or 3d game.  Simply log in, click "Make a game" and then choose the type of game you want to make.  Once the creator loads, you can design your playfield and drag and drop objects onto it to create your game.  After you are done, click "Save" to save your game.  Once your game is saved, you can click "Publish" to share it with everyone.</p>

<h4>How do I put my game on my page?</h4>
<p>To post a game on your web site, just click the "Get Code" button on the Publish Page and copy the code in the form box, then paste it into your site.</p>
<p><em>To get to the Publish Page:</em></p>
<blockquote>If your game is already published: Log in, and go to "My Games", then click on your game.</blockquote>
<blockquote>If your game has not been published: Log in, go to "Make a Game", load your game, and click "Publish".  Once you publish, the Publish page will be shown in a pop-up window.</blockquote>

<h4>I put the code on my site, but my game doesn't work!  What do I do?</h4>
<p>There are many different types of publishing software out there for creating your own web pages, so the process of pasting the code into your site may differ depending on whether the publishing system is online, or on your desktop.  Every application has a slightly different method.  But, if you can see and manipulate the HTML code on your web page, or enter HTML code directly into your Content Management System, then it should be quite simple.</p>
<p>However, some applications will attempt to modify your code after your post.  If an application changes your HTML code, then it is possible that it will break the code that makes the game work.  Once you post your game, and preview your page, and if the game does not work, do the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Right-click (CTRL-click for Mac) on your page, and click "View Source".</li> 
	<li>Look at the HTML code on your page.  Find the Game code that you pasted.  (It may be hard to find.  It's easier if you do a search for the term "sploder".)</li>
	<li>Compare the game code on your page to the code that was given to you on the Publish page.</li>
</ol>
<p>If they two sets of code are different, it means that your publishing software is attempting to modify your code.  Try and locate any settings in your software that may modify your code and turn them off.  Also, you can try opening your HTML page in a simple text editor, pasting the game code, and then FTPing your updated page to your server.</p>
<p>If you continue to have problems, please post the URL of the page where you attempted to post your game to the forum and someone will help you. </p>
