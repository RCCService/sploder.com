<p>Sploder is a place where anyone can make games online and share them with the world. Make your own platformer games, space-themed shoot-em-ups, retro arcade games, and even complex physics-based puzzle games. 
    No programming skill is necessary. All you need is a good imagination and a desire to be creative.</p>

<h4>Our Mission</h4>

<p>We believe that the world can be changed by creative people who use their minds to make the world better. By offering a place where people are rewarded for creativity in the context of games and play, we hope to point them toward a path to a more creative future.</p>

<h4>Commitment to Learning</h4>

<p>If you are a parent or a teacher, you can get more information about using Sploder in a family or educational environment on our <a href="parents-teachers.php">Parents &amp; Teachers page</a>.

<h4>Joining Sploder</h4>

<p>Joining Sploder is easy and free. No personal information is needed, and once you <a href="join.php">join</a> you can start making games right away.</p>


<h4>Community & Safety</h4>

<p>Sploder's community is self-regulating. We have a team of community members who monitor site content daily. Social features of Sploder can be disabled in your account settings if you wish to have a more private experience.</p>
<p>In order to allow for a fast-paced, dynamic online experience, games and comments are automatically allowed and visible. This may be a concern for some parents, so please educate your child about online safety. There is no ability for private conversation on Sploder (aside from the forums, which is a separate registration process) so that moderators and members can report inappropriate or objectionable content.</p>
