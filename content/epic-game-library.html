    <p>Undeadspider was one of the first users on Sploder to really build upon the shooter and try new ideas, and this game definitely shows that. Chain Reaction was possibly the first puzzle-like game ever created on Sploder using many door puzzles- this game has also been often overshadowed by tookewl's 'Escapee' which was inspired by this great game. It features groundbreaking game mechanics that inspired many other game creators, and are still being used and improved upon to this day. The design is very unique, and with plenty of puzzles to solve and enemies/bosses to fight it still manages to be a fun and entertaining game. For a game made way back in early 2008, this game will not disappoint you.</p>

    <p>Back in 2008 the shooter creator saw practically no puzzles due to it being geared towards action games, but Tookewl saw potential in other areas. Tookewl, using pieces in new and exciting ways, created what is considered to be the first puzzle game on Sploder. While it is not without flaws and has fewer puzzles than most people remember; Escapee is a game that many shooters owe a large portion of their existence to. </p>

    <p>Duck has a simple idea to it that few shooters can easily replicate now-a-days due to lag; it is a robot game that has a focus on letting the player explore if and how they want to. One player might play through the game quickly while another may explore and spend well over 10 minutes wandering around finding new things. While it has some of the common issues most games of the time had; it is another impressive showcase by Tookewl.</p>

    <p>While this game may not have revolutionized much of anything; it manages to be a great example of the modern shooter taking form. It manages to pull out both challenging puzzles (for the time) and some amazingly hard and challenging action with about the closest you could get to flying colors for the time. One of the secrets of the game is that it uses its most intense sequences early to minimize lag during the more thought provoking puzzles later in the game.</p>

    <p>Featuring quite possibly the greatest boss in the history of Sploder, as well as very clever puzzles and rooms, Locked In is quite possibly Tookewl's best game.</p>

    <p>This is a very old game, published on March 6, 2008. Back when it was released, Obe and Tookewl really were the only good game makers on the site. Back then, this was probably the best game on the site, and nowadays it's still a great amount of fun. What it did for game making on the website is amazing, and any list of the best games on Sploder that doesn't have The One near or at the top is a very uninformed list.</p>

    <p>This game has no enemies. Which is amazing to me how it is still so hard. This game's puzzles are great. This game brought out where your jumping and you have to climb your way up. This game made it because the advancement in jumping puzzles and traps that have now been brought into platformer.</p>

    <p>The gameplay is pretty good, but the real reason members remember this game was the way this game revolutionized platformer decorations. 7grant2 was posssibly the first to notice that with this feature, he could now make his game look like truely amazing.</p>

    <p>A game of truely epic proportions. Rest assured, you will see many more games by Tookewl as this list continues. The gameplay is amazing, with epic bosses, brilliant puzzles, and unique action sequences. But what truely makes this game quite possibly the best on the site is the plot. Tookewl does what no other game maker had ever done before him - and what very few did even after the game - and wrote one of the most graphic, emotional, and one of the longest plots in the history of Sploder. My personal favorite game.</p>

    <p>One of the most intense platformer games ever created. Every second, you're mere inches away from falling to the bottom and having to restart. There will be moments where you are about to fall, only to save yourself in the nick of time with your Grapple. It's short, but sweet.</p>

    <p>Heart-bouding action is included in this game by the creator, Darut1234! When you are csplode to death than headless person with no body, you must fight to find an escape, and quick, which is what makes this game so darn good. Awesomely made, this game deserves to be on this list.</p>

    <p>Up there with Duck as the king and queens of Sploder robot games. In fact, it's a lot like Duck, in the way that you can play straight through it or attempt to find everything that the game offers. The lag is a bit of a problem, but not enough so to make the game anything less then amazing.</p>

    <p>This game doesn't really revolutionize anything, but amount of effort and love that went into the creation of this, and the fact that neal found a way to twist ordinary sequences into new things by introducing new yet subtle soltuions to things we thought were already figured out, coupled with the obvious nods to mario games and platformers alike, with the sly yet brilliant commentary on all sploder games that was evident throughout this entire game.....neal has pulled off not only an amazing feat, but has completely changed the landscape of platformers as we know them.</p>

    <p>Shayminlord is known for making very hard games of high quality. So, what makes this one different? For a start, this game gives a constant challenge, where one hit will usually kill you with well placed traps and puzzles. The game is long enough to compete to see who can go the farthest without having to worry about a quick end, due to this the game is very addicting. While it lacks in scenery, it's lack of lag and great game-play steals the show. The game may not be for everyone, but those who are skilled enough to get far into it will enjoy it immensely.</p>

    <p>There are many unusual things about this game name choice, so, everyone should check it out. Flicker had revelotionized sploder from the begining on, from atleast my opinion because it had the puzzle-poly flicking on+off one after the other and so on throught the entire game. Liv33vil had incourperated one of the best techniques yet, which, therefore makes this game reveloutionary in my perspective. It is evident that Flicker has many great techniques, puzzles, and difficulty.</p>

    <p>From what I've seen, Bgscurtis' games are top-notch. Well, this game included was not just top-notch, it broke my applouse-o-meter. Well, Defeat The Yeti reveloutionized sploder because of its capability of health, action, and hunting of crystals. This game had some hard-to-reach crystal places and was frustrating me throughout the entire game. However, there was a downer in this game...you could easily skip some enemies that were obviouslly misplaced. There was decent enemy placement except for those flaws. Consequently, Defeat The Yeti had great action, health placement, objective placement and much more!</p>

    <p>Most members consider Bobbler the greatest platformer game maker, and this assumption is not without reason. EpicX was a very good game, if a bit short. This game fixes what few flaws the origional had, and adds in things you've never seen done on a platformer before.</p>

    <p>Opprobrium is an impressive platformer in every sense of the word. Firstly, it hooks the player in with an ingenious puzzle, and it gets better from there, because Superpiggy introduces a plethora of new puzzles, puzzles that made uses of the new objects of the platformer update that no one had ever thought of before, all working to keep the player guessing and having fun. These puzzles would go on to be seen in a lot of platformers afterwards, and are still widely used today. Oh, and how could I not leave out that this game is quite possibly the longest single-level platformer ever created? That's right, its an array of clever puzzles, surprises, and intense action, lasting a good 20 minutes. This game is no doubt one of THE best of the newer platformers.</p>

    <p>Pausing Physics is a beyond unique game produced by the one and only Whtever. This game is truly outstanding because of the original game-play. Whtever found an amazing glitch and adopted it into his entire game. Not only does he force you to use the glitch, but incredibly, he made you complete brain-bursting multiple puzzles with this exciting glitch! These puzzles were well thought out and inspirational. The entire concept of this game was brilliant, and I am pleased to announce that Whtever really nailed this platformer.</p>

    <p>A lot of thought and effort went into CyberGangstar, Bobbler's latest offering in the platformer genre. Bobbler adds a funny storyline that's full of slang and stereotypes, while upholding a somewhat serious tone. An open-world, sandbox-style theme has a presence throughout the game as the gamer has the option to race through the game or find everything that CyberGangstar has to offer. Stylized action sequences and puzzles are laced throughout the game, just one of the many reasons why it rests on Epic Game Library's shelves now.</p>

    <p>On Sploder, we have some innovative and creative games, and if there is a game that fits those two adjectives, it's Psychotic Pong 2 by Youngcaliman. Youngcaliman was able to turn the simple game of Pong into something more. He used creative puzzles of moving the ball between zones and to the end goal. This game has been the basis for many others, and is revolutionary amongst other PPGs, utilizing the camera to create intricate puzzles, and making the player think about where and what they are going to do next.

    <p>Black Widow is a platformer of epic proportions. At first glance this game may seem like your average platformer, but when/if you ever get to the end of this very difficult game, you will find that it is brilliant. Even the background, which seems a bit plain serves a great purpose in this game. This game brings forth some new puzzles and a great maze-like gameplay.

    <p>The Jabberwocky by Raquzzic is what many sploder members would consider as a "beast" game. Raquzzic has made many great games and many of them of huge proportions, this game is no different. If you plan to beat this game you're going to be playing it for quite a while, each level offering extremely challenging yet fun gameplay that'll keep you playing for hours. Raq is known also for excellence in putting together platformer scenery that keeps on throughout the game from simple but effective, to complex and brilliant. An interesting storyline is also present in this game, topping off the game.

    <p>This isn't just the name of the game. Energy is something that you'll need to complete this game. There are puzzles at every turn, some recycled some new. This however, is not what made this game different from other ones. The way he used switchpolys in this game was revolutionary. It's not going to be given away, so you'll just have to play the game to find out.</p>

    <p>Lonely Roads is truly a game of epic proportions. Not only is it long, hard, and creative, it is also the first real multi leveled RPG to ever be inducted into the EGL. It could also be one if not the longest game ever created on sploder, taking at least 2 hours to complete all that the game has to offer. Spell has created a brilliant work of art, not to mention the sheer amount of effort put into this game. This game definitely deserves it spot amongst the other greatest games. The ideas Spell was able to create were beyond many others, making one of the best RPG's on this site, not to mention that this is Spell's first platformer making it even more impressive that he has come this far in one try. This game very well takes it spot on the shelves of the Epic Game Library.</p>

    <p>Quest Zone is the first multi-level'd puzzle platformer ever to be inducted into the Epic Game Library, and it's obvious to see that this game would stand out in a crowd. Credit must be given to Stanleykitten for creating the scenery in this game, and with good reason. The visually appealing maps that were designed by Stanley allows the puzzles to shine even brighter, as it is perhaps some of the best scenery ever used in a platformer. Moolatycoon created the rest of the game, including the marvelous variety of puzzles. Each level is a different theme, and each theme utilizes different puzzles that match the theme beautifully. Much thought was put into each level in every aspect of the game. With the combination of StanleyKitten's stunning scenery and Moolatycoon's enticing array of puzzles, Quest Zone has rightfully earned a space within the Epic Game Library shelves.</p>

    <p>Paint It Black is Youngcaliman's second platformer voted into the EGL.  The moment it came out there was something special about it.  For the first time ever, the story seems to actually help the gameplay.  You will find a fair dose of symbolism in every level of this game.  The story actually paints out the gameplay.  The story isn't the only thing that makes this game worthy of being called epic though.  You will find many great puzzles, and memorable boss fights.  You may also want to go into this game expecting a challenge.  It's not as hard as other games, but it may still result in flying fists.  In the end, you shouldn't be dissatisfied with this wonderful game.</p>

    <p>Moolatycoon has already made a great feat with Quest Zone, with it placing in the EGL, but Chapter II was just as good. Chapter II offers a unique twist each level, from jumping into a massive labyrinth, and even working your way up to the CEO of a business. The scenery is exquisite, helping the levels to shine even brighter. The game leaves players sitting on the edge of their seat, heart racing, as the game can bring you close to death in a matter of seconds. Not only this, but the game has a marvelous exploration and open feel to the game, leaving the last part of the adventurer satisfied. Chapter II has definitely earned its place among Sploder's best games.</p>

    <p>The original GrandQuest, in spite of some flaws regarding performance and design, helped to spark the creation of large platformers making full use of the scale the creator can allow. GrandQuest: Darkest Hour takes the original game and fixes nearly every complaint about it. It's very responsive with a faster pace and better puzzles while simultaneously managing to push out even more vividly detailed environments than the previous game. While the writing is of dubious quality, the overall experience is filled to the brim with loads of highly polished content that keeps players coming back time and time again.</p>

    <p>Defensified (also known as Mrdragon) is especially known for his creative style when it comes to the shooter creator, and this creation especially is nothing short of amazing. This game introduces very original puzzles and tricks from the very beginning. Number 4 is a very intense shooter, and only those who are determined enough will be able to complete this game. However, if you are able to witness a majority of what the game has to offer, you will discover sequences of game play that you will not find in any other shooter on the site. Number 4 also offers an engaging storyline that allows the puzzles to come together in a way that will certainly leave you awestruck. Number 4 is truly an innovative creation designed by a master when it comes to the shooter creator. Number 4 is certainly one of the best shooters on the site, and thus deserves a spot amongst the best.</p>

    <p>Youngcaliman is becoming one of the best game makers Sploder has ever had, I think it's agreeable that he's the best game maker of present times; and he's come out with another awesome game. Psychotic Pong 3 not only lived up to the hype, but it surpassed it. If you're interested in puzzle games, Psy Pong 3 is the one for you, with more creative and intricate puzzles then before, with seemingly nothing in the game without a use. Not to mention the fact that Young has created possibly the best PPG Boss Battle to date, keeping the puzzling aspects but also making it intense, more margin for error and makes you keep rushing about for practically the whole time, making it all the more difficult to beat the game.</p>

    <p>There are only a handful of Sploder members that can make a quality 3D game, Youngcaliman is one of them. With Two Souls One Goal, we've witnessed a lot of things, and at least one seemingly revolutionizing the Algorithm creator, which was going back and forth between levels and hitting switches to unlock parts of previous levels; it's something that we haven't seen before, at least not in the way Young did it. Oh, Two Souls One Goal isn't a one trick pony either, Young wrote a fantastic on going poem throughout the game which really brings the player close to the game, even bring tears to someone's eyes (*ahem* tookewl). Anyway, there were many more puzzles throughout the game, and something that I haven't seen often from Young was some intense action, which makes you need to strategize on how you attack as well as figuring out the puzzles. Young used the objects in the creator to his advantage and used a few in ways they haven't been used before. The scenery also plays a part in this game, if you ever get to the end of the game (or just watch it on Youtube) you'll realize what everything means and why it's there. All in all, Two Souls One Goal shows that the Algorithm creator isn't as limited as it seems, which is why it's been inducted into the EGL.</p>

    <p>Troyio is not the most known game maker, but that has now changed. Cythera is an amazing game, and the first Retro Arcade game to be inducted into the EGL, and with a good reason too. This game does things in the creator that are truly stunning, including obstacle courses to heart-racing boss battles. The gameplay isn't the only good thing about this game though, the story is, well, simply putting it, excellent. You can choose options that will effect the game's story, meaning when (or if) you beat the game, you can go back and choose the different story option. Simply putting it, Cythera is an epic game with many innovative sequences.</p>

    <p>Doppelganger is a collab between Jackjoshseb and Elroysice, and is most likely the most unique platformer game you'll ever encounter on Sploder. It features a groundbreaking glitch that allows you to control two players instead of one. The glitch originated on Elroy's account, and will probably never be replicated. You take the role of a test subject, you and your clone must find your way through a labyrinth of puzzles using you and your doppelganger to survive. Every trap and puzzle you come across is completely original, you will have to use problem-solving skills throughout the game as you progress. The incredible plot, puzzles, and overall use of the doppelganger glitch makes this game truly deserve it's spot in the EGL.</p>

    <p>Dark Days is Mat's first game inducted into the EGL, the reasons behind that is clear. This game is one of the best (and largest) exploration platformers on the website. The game has a fantastic story that matches the gameplay for the whole experience, giving the game an amazing atmosphere, as you pass mini sidequests and more. What also stands out from this game is the interaction with the other in-game characters (Shadross must be given credit for the graphics of these characters). Overall, Dark Days is a seriously fun game and a great experience to play - and Mat's finest work yet.</p>

    <p>Chamber of Wisdom 2 is one of the finest puzzle shooters you'll come across, for more reasons than one. The classic shooter was the creator that Sploder launched with, and people have been creating puzzles with it since the beginning of the website. And still, darut managed to add all new challenges and creative puzzles in the second installment of Chamber of Wisdom (a game who's predecessor was made as early as 2008). Most games of this genre will throw near-impossible traps at you which ends up making the game purely trial and error. With CoW2, you are constantly given slight hints on what to do next. It's a game where paying attention to your surroundings and knowing how the shooter works will guarantee you eventual victory. In the end, Chamber of Wisdom 2 is simply put a very innovative game which is crafted much better than the average shooter. Every sequence is unique, and it will consistently make you think throughout the game.</p>

    <p>JJS has always been known for making great games, and this is no exception.  This is his first solo game inducted into the EGL (and his first 3D game, which is amazing that it’s been inducted into the EGL), and by all means, it deserves it.  The game has a fresh story, and plenty of original gameplay.  JJS managed to find a way to work with such small amounts of space, and still come up with wonderful puzzles that haven’t been seen before.  King Aegon is a 3D game that has rightly earned its place in the EGL aside Youngcaliman’s ‘Two Souls One Goal’.  Go now, and enjoy this great game, which is just the 2nd Algorithm game sitting in the EGL today.</p>

    <p>The Better Man is another top notch 3D Algorithm game, produced by none other than Youngcaliman. Young set out in an attempt to top his previous 3D (Two Souls One Goal), which is widely recognized as the best on the website. Whether he achieved that or not is up in the air, but with far more advanced backtracking through levels (complimented by the level design), a storyline told through poetry, intense action rooms and a brand new creative boss battle, The Better Man certainly makes a good case. Being just the 3rd 3D game to make the EGL (behind Two Souls One Goal and King Aegon), TBM is defnitely a game worth playing (10 fold).</p>
