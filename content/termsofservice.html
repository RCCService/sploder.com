<h5>Service Scope and Usage</h5>

<p class="note">Sploder's servers do not have unlimited bandwidth.  Bandwidth limitations apply for all users. Users may not post games hosted on Sploder's servers in such a fashion that the same game is repeated multiple times on the same 
page, nor needlessly repeated on many pages of a site.  This includes bulletin-board sig-files and sites' global navigation.  This causes 
repeated, redundant, and sometimes concurrent downloads from Sploder's servers, and quickly uses up bandwidth.</p>

 Sploder&trade; reserves the right to terminate the user's account. Users must not attempt to circumvent the security and

<p class="note">Sploder&trade; reserves the right to terminate service to you if you do not meet these terms. Sploder&trade; will also cooperate with authorities through its respective service providers.</p>

<p class="note">Sploder&trade; cannot be held responsible for limitations placed on the system by its service providers.</p>
